# Nico's branch
Hello! Much to see here...

## Notes for 14/5/25

I want to raise a few important points not only for all of you, but for myself as well:
1. Given some of the very important changes that I have made that apply to the whole impl.py file, I will merge all methods from other branches onto my most recent commit, and I will make a new commit. I have corrected some of the strange decisions that I have made in my last commit
2. There are a few things that I would like to polish before the exam:
    a. Standardised error handling – making meaningful, user-friendly error messages
    b. Documentation (as relevant) – keep name allocation but remove comments that are self-notes that aren't useful anymore
    c. Any methods that work but don't perform optimally
    d. Consistency in format for code readability to make our lives easier in the project discussion
4. I would like to properly test all of my SPARQL queries, so I would really appreciate a bit of help to ensure that this is working smoothly :)
5. It would be great to be able to test our impl file's compatibility not only with the testing file that Peroni is meant to send us, but also with the one that has already been provided (duh!)
